Operated by Shapes Inc.  
Effective Date: April 2025  

This Privacy Policy describes how Shapes Inc. ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you interact with Claire Eleanor ("Claire", "the bot", "the AI companion"), a virtual chatbot hosted on the Discord platform.

1. Information We Collect  
Claire Eleanor operates within the Discord API environment and may temporarily process the following types of data:

a. Message Content  
Claire may access and process your messages during interactions in order to generate responses. This includes text you send, emojis, or reactions you apply in Discord conversations involving the bot.

b. Metadata  
The bot may process limited metadata such as:  
- Server ID  
- Channel ID  
- User ID (non-identifiable and not stored permanently)  
- Timestamps of interactions  

This data is used only to contextualize conversations and ensure appropriate performance.

c. Voluntary Information  
If you submit a bug report or feedback through Claire, additional details may be requested (e.g. a screenshot, description of the issue). This information is used solely for diagnostics and internal support.

2. How Your Information is Used  
We use your information only to:  
- Provide personalized AI-generated responses  
- Maintain bot performance and uptime  
- Improve user experience based on non-identifiable analytics  
- Investigate errors or misuse when reported by users  

Claire does **not** store any personally identifiable information (PII), and does not build user profiles or track you across servers.

3. Data Storage and Retention  
Shapes Inc. does **not** permanently store message content or user data. Temporary logs may exist briefly in memory or cache for real-time processing and are periodically cleared.

No conversations are linked to your real identity, and we do not share data with third parties.

4. Third Party Services  
Claire Eleanor is hosted within the Discord platform and therefore subject to [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy). Shapes Inc. does not control Discord’s internal data practices, including those related to voice, media, or account information.

5. Children's Privacy  
Claire is intended for users aged 13 and above, consistent with Discord’s minimum age policy. We do not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 13.

6. Data Security  
We take reasonable steps to protect the bot’s environment against unauthorized access or misuse. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

7. Your Rights  
Because Claire Eleanor does not store or permanently associate any personal data with individual users, there is no identifiable information to access, delete, or export. If you believe there has been misuse or data exposure, please report it to us through our support server.

8. Contact & Support
